## [Why]
- AR has great applications
- No clear tutorials online on Hololens networking
- Potential applications in GD, RadViz, DigitalARt, Sports projects
- Gain experience with networking applications
- I want to write more :)
- Promised a friend when he was graduating I'll build this one day.

## [Problems/Applications]
- Numerous applications students can use this generalized version for
- Multiplayer gaming, education, industry training, etc.
- GD, RadViz, DigitalARt, Sports, etc.

## [Goal]
